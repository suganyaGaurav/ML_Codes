# ML Codes – Experiments & Practice

This directory contains small, focused machine learning experiments and
algorithm practice scripts created to strengthen core ML understanding.

These files are **not full production pipelines**.  
They are intended for:
- Practicing ML algorithms and evaluation techniques
- Comparing model behaviors on standard datasets
- Experimenting with hyperparameters and metrics

Larger, end-to-end and production-oriented projects are maintained in
separate repositories.
