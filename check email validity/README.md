## Email Validation Using Regular Expressions

### Objective
To understand how regular expressions can be used to validate
the structure of an email address in Python.

### Key Learnings
- Structure of an email: `local_part@domain`
- Use of character classes and quantifiers
- Anchors (`^` and `$`) to enforce full-string matching
- Difference between format validation and actual email verification

### Limitations
- Does not support all valid email formats defined by RFC standards
- Does not validate domain existence
- Designed for learning and demonstration purposes
