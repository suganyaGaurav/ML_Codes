# Time Series Forecasting – ARIMA

## Overview

This module contains a classical **time series forecasting experiment**
using the **ARIMA** model on foreign exchange (FX) rate data.

The goal is to practice:
- Stationarity testing
- Time series transformations
- ACF and PACF analysis
- ARIMA modeling
- Rolling forecast evaluation

This is a **learning and experimentation module**, not a production system.

## Dataset

- Foreign exchange rate data (Euro → USD)
- Time-indexed numerical series

## Techniques Used

- Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity
- Log transformation and differencing
- ACF & PACF plots for parameter selection
- ARIMA modeling
- Residual diagnostics
- Rolling one-step forecast evaluation

## Key Learnings

- Non-stationary time series require transformation
- Differencing improves stationarity
- ACF/PACF guide ARIMA order selection
- Rolling forecasts provide realistic evaluation

## Notes

- No deployment included
- No hyperparameter optimization
- Intended for conceptual understanding of classical time series methods
